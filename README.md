# budget.web.application 💯💯💯💯

Application to add Income and Expenses, and can automatically return the available budget.  
Functions: 
- Add Income and Expenses with a value and description of each. 
- Return the Total of all Revenues and Expenses. 
- Return a Budget


Application as a project developed in the JS University course at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/101w5G3@20lXp9e8IQTONuOSu64gv4TG34p-c5L1IroINSWwrIKTCznQJCgbsDMAhwKJvOrinQ==/), it is developed using JS, HTML and CSS technologies with all the love ❤️❤️❤️❤️

It is a very short documentation, since there is not much to say, but I can say that it was a good app for practice:

- POM with JS
- DOM Management with JS
- CSS effects

You can find the project here, on a [server](https://sebasttiandaza.github.io/budget.web.application/).
